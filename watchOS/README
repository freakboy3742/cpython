This document provides a overview of eccentricities of building and using
Python on watchOS devices (i.e., AppleTV).

Build instructions
==================

The watchOS build must be run on an Mac with XCode installed. To build the watchOS
framework, unpack the Python sources, move into the watchOS subdirectory, and
run ``make``. There are no configuration options to this build process -
it will use XCode utilities to identify the location of compilers,
resource directories, and so on.

The build process will configure and build Python 3 times, producing:

    * A "host" version of Python
    * A version of Python compiled for the i386 watchOS Simulator
    * A version of Python compiled for ARMv7k watchOS devices

Build products will be "installed" into watchOS/build. The built products will
then be combined into a single "fat" ``Python.framework`` that can be added to
an XCode project. The resulting framework will be located in the root
directory of the Python source tree.

A ``make clean`` target also exists to clean out all build products;
``make distclean`` will clean out all user-specific files from the test and
sample projects.

Test instructions
-----------------

The ``Tools`` directory contains an ``watchOS-Test`` project that enables you to
run  the Python regression test suite. When you run ``make`` in the watchOS
directory,  a copy of ``Python.framework`` will also be installed into this
test project.

To run the test project, load the project into XCode, and run (either on a
device or in the simulator). The test suite takes around 10 minutes to run on
an Apple Watch.

.. note:: If you run the test project in debug mode, the XCode debugger will
   stop whenever a signal is raised. The Python regression test suite checks
   a number of signal handlers, and the test suite will stop mid-execution
   when this occurs.

   To disable this signal handling, set a breakpoint at the start of
   ``main.c``; when execution stops at the breakpoint, run the following
   commands in the debugger (at the ``(lldb)`` prompt in the console log
   window)::

       process handle SIGPIPE -n true -p true -s false
       process handle SIGINT -n true -p true -s false
       process handle SIGXFSZ -n true -p true -s false
       process handle SIGUSR1 -n true -p true -s false
       process handle SIGUSR2 -n true -p true -s false

   Unfortunately, this has to be done every time the test suite is executed.

watchOS-specific details
====================

* ``import sys; sys.platform`` will report as `'watchos'`, regardless of whether you
  are on a simulator or a real platform.

* ``import platform; platform.machine()`` will return the device identifier.
  For example, an origianl Apple Watch will return `'Watch1,1'`

* The following modules are not currently supported:

   - ``bsddb``
   - ``bz2``
   - ``curses``
   - ``dbm``
   - ``gdbm``
   - ``hotshot``
   - ``idlelib``
   - ``lzma``
   - ``nis``
   - ``ossaudiodev``
   - ``readline``
   - ``spwd``
   - ``sqlite3``
   - ``ssl``
   - ``tkinter``
   - ``turtledemo``
   - ``wsgiref``

* Due to limitations in using dynamic loading on watchOS, binary Python modules must be
  statically-linked into the executable. The framework package produced by the watchOS
  ``make install`` statically links all the supported standard library modules.
  If you have a third-party Python binary module, you'll need to incorporate the
  source files for that module into the sources for your own app.

  If you want to add or remove a binary module from the set that is included in the
  Python library, you can do so by providing module setup files for each platform.
  There are two default module configuration files:

    - ``Modules/Setup.watchOS-aarch64`` for ARM64 watchOS builds
    - ``Modules/Setup.watchOS-x86_64`` for x86_64 watchOS simulator builds

  If you copy these files to a ``.local`` version (e.g.,
  ``Modules/Setup.watchOS-aarch64.local``), the local version will override the
  default. You can then make modifications to the modules that will be included
  in the watchOS framework, and the flags passed to the compiler when compiling those
  modules.

Adding Python to an watchOS project
===============================

The watchOS subdirectory contains a sample XCode 6.1 project to demonstrate how
Python can be added to an watchOS project. After building the Python watchOS framework,
copy it into the ``watchOS/XCode-sample`` directory. You should end up with a directory
structure that looks like this::

    XCode-sample/
        Python.framework/       - Manually copied into the project
        app/
            sample/
                __init__.py
                main.py         - The Python script to be executed
        app_packages/           - A directory that will be added to the `PYTHONPATH` at runtime
        sample
            Images.xcassets
            en.lproj
            main.c              - The main() definition for the watchOS application
            sample-Info.plist
            sample-Prefix.pch
        sample.xcodeproj        - The XCode project file

If you open the project file is project and run it, you should get output
similar to the following::

You can now modify the provide Python source code, import and use
code from the Python standard library, and add third-party modules to
app_packages.

The sample app is a console-only app, so it isn't of any real practical use.
Python can be embedded into any Objective-C project using the normal Python
APIs for embedding; but if you want to write a full watchOS app in Python, or
you want to access watchOS services from within embedded code, you'll need to
bridge between the Objective-C environment and the Python environment.
This binding isn't something that Python does out of the box; you'll need
to use a third-party library like `Rubicon ObjC`_, `Pyobjus`_ or `PyObjC`_.
