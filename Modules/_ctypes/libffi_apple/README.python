This directory contains the generated source code for running libffi
on iOS platforms (physical and simulator). It contains support for
ARMv7, ARM64, i386 and x86_64 platforms.

libffi requires a code-generation step for Apple platforms. This code
generation is performed using the `generate-darwin-source-and-headers.py`
script in the home directory of the libffi project.

This directory is the combined output of the darwin_common and darwin_ios
generated code directories. It has been pruned of source files that are
not needed for ctypes.

The code is from libffi v3.3rc0, released 2 April 2018.
